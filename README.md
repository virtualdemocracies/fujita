# 🌸 Fujita (Wisterias Field) — Grow Your Platform Like a Living Organism
 Fujita is an **open-source** framework to rethink how we manage, build, and evolve software platforms. 

Modern project management tools focus on tasks — but tasks don’t tell the story of your platform’s health, growth, or architecture. Fujita flips the script: instead of a flat task board, you get a living inverted tree that represents your platform from its roots to its most distant leaf. And every piece of it grows **through semver and 3D or 2D(if you prefer) Graphical UI.**

## 🌳 The Philosophy
Fujita is built on a simple idea:

**Software platforms are not just collections of tasks. They are living organisms that grow, evolve, and mature.**

Every system has a root — the platform itself. It branches out into Modules, which in turn branch into Leafs — Interfaces and Services that deliver real functionality.

#### Each part of this tree has:

- A version starting at 0.0.0

- A set of specifications — the DNA of that piece (Genome)

- Tasks to fulfill the spec - The interpretation of the specs into Finished Entities (Epigenome)

- Semantic versioning rules that tell us when something is maturing

When every fundamental spec in a module is completed, that module reaches 1.0.0. When every module is matured, the platform itself hits 1.0.0. You get a true, structured sense of readiness.

## 🧬 How It Works
Platform as a Tree
Visualize your platform like a growing tree — from root to modules to leafs.

Specs over Tasks
Instead of throwing tasks on a board, define specifications. Then assign tasks that build them.

Semantic Growth
Each piece (leaf/module/platform) evolves via Semantic Versioning. Every change is meaningful.

Snapshots & History
Every time a meaningful set of specs is implemented, the platform's story evolves — you get a new “picture” of the organism. Think Git meets Blender: version-controlled, zoomable, layered timelines.

3D Views
Just like architectural tools (think: Blender or BIM), Fujita offers multiple perspectives:

Wireframe (structure view)

Render (functional view)

Team allocation (who’s where?)

Dependency network (infra + software layers)

🔭 Why Use Fujita?
Stop measuring just productivity. Start measuring evolution.

See where your team is concentrated in the organism.

Catch bottlenecks before they become systemic.

Visualize the maturity of your software platform, not just how many tasks are “done.”

## 🌍 Who Is Fujita For?
CTOs and tech leads who want to manage platforms, not just projects

Product-engineering teams aligned by spec-first development

OSS communities that want to track real system maturity

Architecture-driven orgs that treat software as long-living infrastructure

🚧 Roadmap (WIP)
 Visual Inverted Tree UI

 CLI & Web interface for versioning and structure

 Git integration (semantic commit to tree bump)

 Team/Org allocation overlays

 Exportable “Snapshots” as changelogs or reports

 Blender-style view modes (structure, function, people)

## 🌱 Origins & Contribution
### 🫘  Originator and Maintainer
Fujita was proposed and is maintained by ViDAs – Virtual Democracies Association – a non-profit dedicated to reimagining digital infrastructure as open, evolving, and democratic.
ViDAs stewards Fujita as a public digital organism: open-source, community-grown, and structurally designed for collective maintenance.

### 🧬 OSS embedded in its Genome
Fujita is a public good. It belongs to the commons — governed and evolved by those who nurture it. Every contributor is a gardener of its growth.

### 💧 Main Contributor
Olkeey is the first adopter and main corporate contributor to Fujita.
By integrating Fujita as the foundation of its own platform strategy, Olkeey helps shape and expand the framework, growing it from concept into reality.

### 🤝 Contribute
Fujita is in early stages. We’re building this not just as a tool, but as a new way of thinking about software.

Whether you're a developer, architect, designer, or product thinker, help this organism to blossom

### 🧠 Final Thought

#### “Don’t just track tasks. Watch your platform grow.”

#### Let’s build living systems, not just done lists.
#### Let’s grow together — one spec, one version, one snapshot at a time.
#### Let's Seed a Florest of Organic Systems
